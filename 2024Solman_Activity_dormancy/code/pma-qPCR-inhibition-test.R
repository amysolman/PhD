#This script provides:
#1. Tests for qPCR inhibition due to PMA inteference.

#plot 1: undiluted and normalised diluted samples plot as a scatter plot with a line of equality to show if, after normalising, 
#the diluted samples had similar qPCR values (e.g. the dots were on the line of equality).
#plot 2. Bland-Altman difference plot (a.k.a Tukey mean-difference plot), is a method of plotting data to see how much they agree!
#it plots the mean of two datapoints, by their difference.

#qPCR inhibition will be considered present if there is a one log increase in gene copies mL-1 in normalised diluted samples compared to undiluted samples. For example, if mean undiluted sample quantity is 1 x 10^5 gene copies mL-1 and the mean normalised diluted sample quantity is 1x10^6 gene copies mL-1 we would confirm there is a qPCR inhibition due to copurified substances.
