#Canonical correspondence analysis
1) Clear workspace and load packages
2) Import data
3) Extract species, environmental and spatial data
4) Subset environmental data to variables of interest
5) Perform CCA and partial CCA
6) Select variables that be explain the species matrix
7) Calculate Variance inflation Factors for our environmental variables and remove those with collinearity
8) Re-run CCA, variable selection and VIP analysis
9) Call model to see results
10) Test significance of model
11) Plot model
